# Colmar Academy

## Description

This is our assessment to put all our knowledge into practice! You will create the [Codecademy's Colmar Project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/learn-how-to-build-websites-capstone-project/modules/colmar-academy/projects/colmar-academy).

## Resources

- [spec file](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


## Setup

As it is intended to be done all on your own environment, you may not want to follow along my steps. So feel free to do it any way you see fit.

- `fork` and `git clone` the repo to get the necessary files. 
- `cd colmar-academy`
- `code .` 
- `touch index.html`
- `open index.html`

## Recommendations

When you see measurements in pixels, consider using [bootstrap's built in spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/). This will make the site more responsive.
